INTRODUCTION

Project Description
The purpose of this project is to design, implement, and test a small-scale weather station as an embedded system with remote monitoring capabilities, in order to demonstrate practical applications of electronic design principles, sensor integration, and Internet of Things (IoT)-based data transfer and visualization.
The weather station will measure and process various meteorological parameters, including air temperature, humidity, air pressure, altitude, heat index, and soil moisture. The collected data will then be stored in a database, accessible both locally at the weather station on a 2.8-inch TFT Graphical Display and remotely via a web-based graphical user interface (GUI).

System Specifications
Section 1: The Embedded System Weather Station shall:
  read and process information from diverse sensors, incorporating at minimum the parameters of air temperature, air pressure, altitude, humidity, heat index, and soil moisture.
  process and transmit sensor data through a WiFi connection to section 2 of the system, which involves web-based data collection, processing, storage, and display.

Section 2: Web-Based Data Collection, Processing, Storage and Display System shall: 
  collect sensor data from section 1 of the system, which is the embedded system weather station
  process and store the collected data in an online database.
  provide access to and display the stored data through a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) in a user-friendly format.
